Our packaging consists of high-density expanded polypropylene corners, corrugated bottom and top caps, vertical edge protectors and clear stretch wrap, ensuring increased visibility for proper orientation when handling, while minimizing packaging waste. Barcode scanning ensures speed and accuracy, and we manage all logistics and shipping requirements to your distribution facility or direct to the customer site.</p>
    <p>Woodlore casegoods are packaged using expanded polypropylene protectors, recycled pulp corners and corrugated trays, all wrapped in stretch film. This has reduced both packaging waste and shipping damage.</p>
