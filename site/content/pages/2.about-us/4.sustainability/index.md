    <h5 class="orange bold">Sustainability is the capacity to endure</h5>
    <p>For humans, sustainability is the long-term maintenance of responsibility, which has environmental, economic, and social dimensions, and encompasses the concept of stewardship, the responsible management of resource use.</p>
    <p>At Woodlore, sustainability improvements are every bit as important as efficiency improvements. In addition to producing a quality product at a very attractive price, we are committed to safeguarding our environment today and for the future.</p>

<div class="block">
    <h5 class="orange bold">Renewable Energy Credits</h5>
    <p>Renewable energy facilities generate renewable energy credits (RECs) when they produce electricity. Purchasing these credits is the widely accepted way to reduce the environmental footprint of electricity consumption and help fund renewable energy development. Purchasing RECs in the same quantity as electricity consumption guarantees that the energy used is added to the power grid from a renewable energy facility and supports the further development of these facilities.</p>
</div>


<div class="block">
    <h5 class="orange bold">Woodlore</h5>
    <p>We have made a commitment to participate in a Renewable Energy Certificate program, whereby we purchase renewable energy credits equal to 100% of our electricity consumption. This means we are supporting the generation of renewable energy and the development of carbon reduction projects. In so doing, we are helping to prevent over 3,335,000 pounds of CO2 from entering the atmosphere each year.</p>

<div class="block">
    <h5 class="orange bold">FSC® Certified</h5>
    <p>The Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) is an international non-profit, multi-stakeholder organization established to promote responsible management of the world’s forests. Its main tools for achieving this are standard-setting, independent certification and labelling of forest products. This offers customers around the world the ability to choose products from socially and environmentally responsible forestry.</p>

    <h5 class="orange bold">Other Woodlore Initiatives</h5>
    <p>Woodlore uses 100% ABS edgebanding in our manufacturing processes. This represents a major elimination of PVC and its associated VOCs (volatile organic compounds) which are known to be toxic at the end of the products’ lifecycle.</p>
    <p>Woodlore is extremely efficient at grouping and optimizing our board cutting patterns so as to minimize board waste. In addition, scrap wood is ground-up and the material is collected, with over 99% being diverted from landfill to use in a “Waste-to-Energy” program. Woodlore has a goal to achieve 100% solid waste diversion from landfill by 2025.</p>
    <p>Woodlore casegoods are packaged using expanded polypropylene protectors, recycled pulp corners and corrugated trays, all wrapped in stretch film. This has reduced both packaging waste and shipping damage.</p>
    <p>Included in Woodlore’s Governing Principles is a commitment to “sustainable use of resources through waste reduction, reuse, recycling, clean manufacturing processes and energy conservation”, as well as a dedication to continuous improvement</p>
