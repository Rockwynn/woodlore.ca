    <h5 class="orange bold">Outsourced Manufacturing</h5>
    <p>Let Woodlore be your competitive alternative to overseas sourcing. With our highly-trained engineering team, and our years of manufacturing experience, we can replicate or aesthetically match any casegood line. Whether using your construction methods, finishes and hardware, or our production processes and supply chain contacts, the visual appeal of your design will be maintained.</p>

    <h5 class="orange bold">Engineering</h5>
    <p>If you’re looking at an entirely new product line, our design and engineering team can work collaboratively with you to refine the offering. We can provide a manufacturing perspective and outline how design decisions will impact product efficiency, product durability, and overall cost…and we can produce a prototype in days. Short prototype production cycles, in turn, reduce the time-to-launch. Working with you to define the key units in the line, we can create the entire product line statement complete with specifications, line drawings, and pricing. Once a product line has been introduced, our standard lead time on catalogued product is 8 business days from receipt of order. Replacement parts ship in 4 days and the majority of custom (non-catalogued) product requirements are ready to ship in 2-4 weeks, depending on the level of complexity.</p>

We will work with you to ensure that we achieve your environmental standards criteria as well.
