            <h5 class="orange bold">Stringent Quality Standards</h5>
            <p>Quality is more than just product construction. We ensure that the right product gets to the right place on time, defect-free and with the proper packaging, hardware, and installation instructions. We measure every quality issue at the end-customer level, not just when it leaves the factory. Meticulous tracking of orders shipped over the last several years measures our quality output at over 99.8% accuracy.</p>

            <h5 class="orange bold">Eight Day Shipping</h5>
            <p>At Woodlore, quick-ship is standard. We ship any catalogued product, in any of our 24 standard finishes in 8 business days from receipt of order, with no quantity limitations. If you need it faster, just let us know. Processes are in place to expedite shipping for those times when it just can’t wait. When it comes to custom product, Woodlore can design, engineer and deliver the majority of custom product requirements in 2-4 weeks, depending on the level of complexity.</p>
